// This is a bit tricky question. We need to attack in different fronts:
//
// First: n(n+1)/2 should trigger the sum of first N numbers.
// Basically, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... a = a(a+1)/2
//
// Second: the maximum input N can be 10^9 which is 1 billion.
//
// What are they asking?
// Find two numbers a and b such that a(a+1)/2 + b(b+1)/2 == N
//
// Now, let's find what is the largest 'a' possible? This is easy:
// a(a+1)/2 <= 10^9
//
// If you solve the above quadratic equation, you will get 'a' to
// be roughly 45000.
//
// Now, we can do this:
// For every number, 'a', between 1 to 45000, we can subtract a(a+1)/2
// from N. This will give us a new number and all we have to do now is
// see if that number is of the form b(b+1)/2. This can be done by
// solving a simple quadratic equation and see if the roots are integers.

        // Now, all we need to do is find if `diff` is of the form b(b+1)/2
        // We can do this by finding the roots of the quadratic equation:
        // b^2 + b - 2N = 0 and see if it has integer roots.
